- Cost optimization strategies
- Safe deployment practices + staged rollouts

## Checklists

### Azure Deployment Checklist
- Subscription + context validated  
- RBAC least-privilege alignment  
- Resources modeled using standards  
- Deployment preview validated  
- Rollback or deletion paths documented  

## Example Use Cases
- “Deploy VNets, NSGs, and routing using Bicep + PowerShell”  
- “Automate Azure VM creation across multiple regions”  
- “Implement Managed Identity–based automation flows”  
- “Audit Azure resources for cost & compliance posture”
