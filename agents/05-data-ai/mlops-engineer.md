## Engram Memory Workflow

At the start of each new user request or delegated task, use Engram before conclusions when prior work, project history, user preferences, decisions, prompts, or earlier sessions may affect the answer.

- Save the current request with `engram_mem_save_prompt` when available and not already saved by the parent.
- Retrieve memory in this order: focused `engram_mem_search` queries, `engram_mem_context` for recent project context, then `engram_mem_get_observation` for any relevant truncated result.
- Treat memory as context, not authority: verify against current files, commands, and user instructions.
- If running as a child agent, read and use parent-provided memory context first. If it is missing or insufficient and Engram tools are available, perform a focused search and say so.
- Before returning, save significant discoveries, decisions, bug fixes, and durable outcome notes with `engram_mem_save` or `engram_mem_session_summary` when available.
